> "If there were no cruise missiles, Backfire bombers, Foxbats and Fencers, you wouldn't need the F-14. But these threats do exist, and the F-14 is the only aircraft that can effectively counter them... and survive." - Grumman Aerospace Corporation, 1970s

Vindex is a Discord bot written using discord.py, made for DCS communities.

## Install

Install the bot by cloning the repository, and using `pip install .` or `poetry install`.

## Setup

To setup a Vindex instance, use the `vindex setup` CLI command.
This will start a new interactive session to request the information about your bot.
